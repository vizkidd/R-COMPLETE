param_id=value= comment(param_id should not be changed)
e_value=1e-05= evalue threshold (Input)
genename_filter=none= Do you want only records with the same genename? can be none/strict/moderate, check documentation for explanation (Input)
flank_len=2000= length of flanking region to extract if annotations(only for UTR) are missing in GTF (Input)
minIdent=25= minimum percentage identity threshold for BLAST RESULTS (Input)
blast_region=cds= region to blast against(if you want to blast across regions (cds-utr) check the script find_orthologs.sh) (Input)
blast_options= -strand plus = Extra options to pass to BLAST (Input)
transcript_delimiter=||= delimiter which splits transcript IDs (do not use equal sign or underscore!) (Input)
seqID_delimiter=::= delimiter which splits sequence IDs (Input)
genomes_path=files/genomes= path to download GENOMES from ensembl(user downloaded GENOMES can also go here, but make sure the names are consistent) (Input/Output)
annos_path=files/annos= path to download GTF annotations from ensembl(user downloaded GTFs can also go here, but make sure the names are consistent) (Input/Output)

subprocess_wait=TRUE= Run transcript labelling subprocesses in foreground? (get_genomes_ensembl.R) (True-runs longer,less memory/False-runs faster,more memory) (Input)
(unused)label_sequence_IDs=True= run label_sequence_IDs script after extraction of transcript regions? (False-SeqIDs not formated, True-SeqIDs are formatted)
plot_path=files/plots= Path to save plot images (Output)
gene_drop_thresh=25= Threshold to filter genes (Input)
orthodb_files_path=../OrthoDB= path to OrthoDB files (Input), check docs to know which files from you need and how to rename them
